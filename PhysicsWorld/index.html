						<i>"What's past, is prologue."</i> <br />
						<br />
						<b>Physics is the language of everything.</b> <br />
						The capering numbers and Greek symbols, the rigorous Axiomatic Method and critical logic left me captivated at first impression.<br />
						With Physics, human beings have been gifted with <b>
							the ability to question, analyze,
							and then describe the state or existence of everything they can hear, feel, smell, watch and touch,
						</b>
						in <b>‚Äòpoems‚Äô</b> with <b>numerical formulas as ‚Äòforms‚Äô</b> and <b>physical quantities as ‚Äòrhymes‚Äô</b>¬†as far as¬†2400 years ago¬†when Democritus hypothesized the concept of atoms. <br />
						As an instance, <b>the¬†elegant quatrain written by Maxwell</b>, depicting the interactions¬†between electric and magnetic fields, embodies <b>the charm of Physics.</b><br />
						<b>I firmly believe in the power and elegance of the language of Physics, which has become like a mother-tongue to me¬†‚Äì I speak it to nature, then I learn from the response.</b><br />
						I gradually found myself especially fond of <b>Astrophysics - the beautiful poem which rationally satisfies my primordial curiosity about space. </b><br />
						<b>I am driven by the mystery behind the formation of planetary systems or¬†galaxies.</b> <br />
						Step by step, I learned to ‚Äòtalk‚Äô and then to ‚Äòwrite‚Äô this Physics language, now I am conversing confidently while conducting research on <b>models of debris disks - interstellar medium. </b><br />

							<b><i>‚ÄúAll stars, including our Sun, form in the immense stellar nurseries that we call nebulae, which we may regard as reservoirs of gas and dust..." -- Brian May </i></b><br />
							<br />
							This might be a bit surprising but... Brian May, my rock n' roll hero, <b>is actually the first Astronomer leading me into Astrophysics.</b> <br />
							<b>I bought an Astronomy book written by him from a flea market, when I was a little little little kid!</b> <br />
							The book is called <b>"Bang! The Complete History of the Universe"</b>. And <b>my favorite chapter is "Chapter 4 Stars and Planets".</b><br />
							Brian explains <b>how small dust partcles accrete to form the stars and planets. He did it clearly and intriguingly.</b> <br />
							And <b>to me at that time, knowing that the huge stars and exoplanets are actually made by the tiny dust particles was incredible</b>...<b>that's how I found Astronomy fun! </b><br />
							<br />
							<b>Astronomy Rocks! </b>Probably it's cool to be an Astronomer.<br />

							<b>Photo Credit: My friend Janety. (I bought the newest version of "Bang! Universe" as her birthday gift.)</b>
							<br />
							<br />
							As I started reading more about Astronomy,<b> I found the study of Planet Formation and ISM meaningful. </b><br />
							Compared to our infinitesimal and brief existence, the long-lasting behemoths ‚Äì stars and planets ‚Äì seem to hide inscrutable secrets about the history of the universe. <br />
							They stand witness to the thirteen-billion-year continuous interactions between all matter and energy which transformed the remnants of the Big Bang into gigantic celestial bodies. <br />
							This awakens my primordial curiosity: ‚ÄúHow do the worlds ‚Äì our solar system and beyond ‚Äì form and evolve?‚Äù <br />
                            During high school, I challenged myself a bit because I was so eager to prepare for an astronomy career.<br />
                            I started to read college textbooks (some of them are listed in the "booklist recommended below"; I became the president of the astronomy club and encouraged a few teenagers to be young amateur astronomers; I participated in a few competitions, from getting silver in BPHO and Physics Bowl in the first year at high school, to 3rd Prize in Chinese Young Physicist Tournament in the junior year...; In my last year of high school, I was lucky enough to be trained professionally for Astrophysics research by a research fellow in the national observatory in China...<br />
                            If you wanna see the details of what I have done and what I have learned in the past, please see <a href="ZodiacalDust.github.io/AboutMe"> AboutMe Page </a>
							Then, in university, I recently joined UW_PlanetFormation Group and I am practicing my coding skills, reading literatures and learning how to use iSLAT!
							TBC...it is just the beginning of my new story! <br />

			<p>
				All the tips are based on my personal learning experience ;) <br />
				<b>For AP Physics 1, 2 or C Students:</b> <br />
				<br />
				If you are currently studying <b>AP Physics 1 or 2</b>...they are <b>only algebra-based and requiring Physics-way-of-thinking more than Math Basics</b>, so I won't give too many tips on Maths. <br />
				Instead, I personally suggest you to read <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Fundamentals+of+Physics%2C+Extended%2C+12th+Edition-p-9781119773511">Fundamental of Physics by David Halliday</a> <br />
				<br />
				<img src="images/FofP.png" /><br />
				<br />
				<b>This book is suitable for beginners</b>, since it <b>starts with basic High-school Physics concepts and gradually extends to College-Introductory-Level-Physics.</b><br />
				<b>You can skip some Calculus extensions in it and this will not affect your reading experience because algebra-based formulas are also given.</b><br />
				<b>If you wanna preview some Physics C (Calculus-Based) or are currently taking AP Physics C courses</b>, this book is still <b>a good choice for you to start.</b> <br />
				<b>If AP Physics is too easy for you, and you are looking for some good College-Physics Books</b>...<br />
				<b>The 1st Volume(Mechanics and Optics) and 2nd Volume(Mainly E.M.) of <a herf="https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/">Feynman Lectures on Physics</a> can be useful. </b> <br />
				<br />
				<img src="images/Feynman.jpg" /><br />
				<br />
				<b>For AP Calculus AB or BC Students:</b><br />
				<br />
				If you are <b>struggling with AP Calculus AB or BC, and the exam is approaching</b>, calm down and see <a href="https://gehangma.github.io/APCalcTips/"> for some simple tips </a> <b>This will help you to get at least a '3'</b><br />
				Personally I suggest every Calculus Beginners to read <a href="https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/thomas-calculus/P200000007103/9780137616077">Thomas Calculus'</a>, it does not require a solid Math foundation (it will guide you step by step to develop one instead.) and contains a ton of good practice problems.<br />
				<br />

				As I mentioned in the 'AP' part, <b><a href="https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/thomas-calculus/P200000007103/9780137616077">Thomas Calculus'</a> can help you to develop a solid foundation of Calculus, including 1st/2nd ODE.</b><br />
				After finishing reading Thomas Calculus, if you want to preview some kinda <b>Linear Algebra</b>, or to dig deeper in <b>Multivairable Calculus</b>, I personally recommend you to read <a href="https://math.mit.edu/~gs/dela/">Gilbert Strang's book - Differential Equations and Linear Algebra</a>. <br />
				<br />
				<img src="images/DE.jpg" /><br />
				<br />
				<a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Fundamentals+of+Physics%2C+Extended%2C+12th+Edition-p-9781119773511">Fundamental of Physics by David Halliday</a> is great for previewing Introductory Level Physics;
				And  <a herf="https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/">Feynman Lectures on Physics</a> is worthy for students already with solid Physics foundation to prepare for a Physics Major.<br />
				If you are interested in Physics Research, please see <a href="arxiv.com"> Arxiv</a> for free NEWEST research preprints :) <br />
				<br />
				<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-53045-0">Fundamental Astronomy</a> is the best introductory-Astronomy-textbook I've ever read ;)

			<p>
				<a href="https://gehangma.github.io/3DWorld/">A simple explanation of Parallax and its application in 3D Photography(Stereoscopics) is here.</a> <br />
				<b>Parallax is the effect of changing position of an object when viewed from different positions.</b><br />
				When you are looking at one object with both your eyes, the <b>slight position difference between your right eye and your left eye</b> can let you <b>observing this object from 2 different angles simultaneously.</b><br />
				The difference in angles of observation will result in the difference in depth.<br />
				3D images, compared to 2D images, have an extra dimension of 'depth. <br />
				See the figure below.<br />

				<img src="images/P_2.png" width="1000px" , height="700px" /><br />
				<br />
				+++ LaTex Formulas
				As you can see,  the depth can be calculated. <br />
				<br />
				<b>THen you may ask, what's the meaning of knowing the Depth?</b><br />
				<b>Well, the Depth information got from Stereoscopic Images is vital in Astronomy (Calculating the distance between us and nearby stars) and Geology (Photogrammetry)</b>
