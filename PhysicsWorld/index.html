                        <br />
                        <b>Physics is the language of everything.</b> <br />
                        The capering numbers and Greek symbols, the rigorous Axiomatic Method and critical logic left me captivated at first impression.<br />
                        With Physics, human beings have been gifted with <b>
                            the ability to question, analyze,
                            and then describe the state or existence of everything they can hear, feel, smell, watch and touch,
                        </b>
                        in <b>‘poems’</b> with <b>numerical formulas as ‘forms’</b> and <b>physical quantities as ‘rhymes’</b> as far as 2400 years ago when Democritus hypothesized the concept of atoms. <br />
                        As an instance, <b>the elegant quatrain written by Maxwell</b>, depicting the interactions between electric and magnetic fields, embodies <b>the charm of Physics.</b><br />
                        <b>I firmly believe in the power and elegance of the language of Physics, which has become like a mother-tongue to me – I speak it to nature, then I learn from the response.</b><br />
                        I gradually found myself especially fond of <b>Astrophysics - the beautiful poem which rationally satisfies my primordial curiosity about space. </b><br />
                        <b>I am driven by the mystery behind the formation of planetary systems or galaxies.</b> <br />
                        Step by step, I learned to ‘talk’ and then to ‘write’ this Physics language, now I am conversing confidently while conducting research on <b>models of debris disks - interstellar medium. </b><br />

                            This might be a bit surprising but... Brian May, my rock n' roll hero, <b>is actually the first Astronomer leading me into Astrophysics.</b> <br />
                            <b>I bought an Astronomy book written by him from a flea market, when I was a little little little kid!</b> <br />
                            The book is called <b>"Bang! The Complete History of the Universe"</b>. And <b>my favorite chapter is "Chapter 4 Stars and Planets".</b><br />
                            Brian explains <b>how small dust partcles accrete to form the stars and planets. He did it clearly and intriguingly.</b> <br />
                            And <b>to me at that time, knowing that the huge stars and exoplanets are actually made by the tiny dust particles was incredible</b>...<b>that's how I found Astronomy fun! </b><br />

                            <br />
                            As I started reading more about Astronomy,<b> I found the study of Planet Formation and ISM meaningful. </b><br />
                            Compared to our infinitesimal and brief existence, the long-lasting behemoths – stars and planets – seem to hide inscrutable secrets about the history of the universe. <br />
                            They stand witness to the thirteen-billion-year continuous interactions between all matter and energy which transformed the remnants of the Big Bang into gigantic celestial bodies. <br />
                            This awakens my primordial curiosity: “How do the worlds – our solar system and beyond – form and evolve?” <br />
                            During high school, I challenged myself a bit because I was so eager to prepare for an astronomy career.<br />
                            I started to read college textbooks (some of them are listed in the "booklist recommended below"; I became the president of the astronomy club and encouraged a few teenagers to be young amateur astronomers; I participated in a few competitions, from getting silver in BPHO and Physics Bowl in the first year at high school, to 3rd Prize in Chinese Young Physicist Tournament in the junior year...; In my last year of high school, I was lucky enough to be trained professionally for Astrophysics research by a research fellow in the national observatory in China...<br />
                            If you wanna see the details of what I have done and what I have learned in the past, please see <a href="ZodiacalDust.github.io/AboutMe"> AboutMe Page </a> <br />
                            <br />
                            When I was applying to university, my parents did not want me to apply for Astrophysics programs - they wished me to pursue a business/economics degree in HongKong or Japan (because my father runs his business there) and work for the family business...<br />
                            <b>BUT I am not interested in the business stuff...I only wanna do what I like to do...</b> <br />
                            They failed to stop me from being an Astrophysics students - I secretly applied for Astrophysics/Physics programs ONLY...And I have got a huge amount of scholarships as the bargaining chip <br />
                            <br />
                            Now, I am an Astronomy+Physics+Math student in University of Wisconsin, pretty much enjoy my college life here:) <br />
                            I recently joined UW_PlanetFormation Group and I am practicing my coding skills, reading literatures and using <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04060">iSLAT</a> to deal with the spectrums<br />
                            <br />
                            TBC...this is just the beginning of a new chapter in my story...<br />

            <p>
                All the tips are based on my personal learning experience ;) <br />
                <b>For AP Physics 1, 2 or C Students:</b> <br />
                <br />
                If you are currently studying <b>AP Physics 1 or 2</b>...they are <b>only algebra-based and requiring Physics-way-of-thinking more than Math Basics</b>, so I won't give too many tips on Maths. <br />
                Instead, I personally suggest you to read <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Fundamentals+of+Physics%2C+Extended%2C+12th+Edition-p-9781119773511">Fundamental of Physics by David Halliday</a> <br />

                <br />
                <b>This book is suitable for beginners</b>, since it <b>starts with basic High-school Physics concepts and gradually extends to College-Introductory-Level-Physics.</b><br />
                <b>You can skip some Calculus extensions in it and this will not affect your reading experience because algebra-based formulas are also given.</b><br />
                <b>If you wanna preview some Physics C (Calculus-Based) or are currently taking AP Physics C courses</b>, this book is still <b>a good choice for you to start.</b> <br />
                <b>If AP Physics is too easy for you, and you are looking for some good College-Physics Books</b>...<br />
                <b>The 1st Volume(Mechanics and Optics) and 2nd Volume(Mainly E.M.) of <a herf="https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/">Feynman Lectures on Physics</a> can be useful. </b> <br />
                <br />
                <img src="images/Feynman.jpg" /><br />
                <br />
                <b>For AP Calculus AB or BC Students:</b><br />
                <br />
                If you are <b>struggling with AP Calculus AB or BC, and the exam is approaching</b>, calm down and see <a href="https://gehangma.github.io/APCalcTips/"> for some simple tips </a> <b>This will help you to get at least a '3'</b><br />
                Personally I suggest every Calculus Beginners to read <a href="https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/thomas-calculus/P200000007103/9780137616077">Thomas Calculus'</a>, it does not require a solid Math foundation (it will guide you step by step to develop one instead.) and contains a ton of good practice problems.<br />

                After finishing reading Thomas Calculus, if you want to preview some kinda <b>Linear Algebra</b>, or to dig deeper in <b>Multivairable Calculus</b>, I personally recommend you to read <a href="https://math.mit.edu/~gs/dela/">Gilbert Strang's book - Differential Equations and Linear Algebra</a>. <br />

                <a href="https://gehangma.github.io/3DWorld/">A simple explanation of Parallax and its application in 3D Photography(Stereoscopics) is here.</a> <br />
                <b>Parallax is the effect of changing position of an object when viewed from different positions.</b><br />
                When you are looking at one object with both your eyes, the <b>slight position difference between your right eye and your left eye</b> can let you <b>observing this object from 2 different angles simultaneously.</b><br />
                The difference in angles of observation will result in the difference in depth.<br />
                3D images, compared to 2D images, have an extra dimension of 'depth. <br />

                As you can see,  the depth can be calculated. <br />

                <b>THen you may ask, what's the meaning of knowing the Depth?</b><br />
                <b>Well, the Depth information got from Stereoscopic Images is vital in Astronomy (Calculating the distance between us and nearby stars) and Geology (Photogrammetry)</b>
