                            Before my journey:<br />
                            ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
                            <br />
                            Well this is my first time to attend such a large world-wide tour so...PRETTY EXCITED ;)<br />
                            Queen is one of my favorites. I have been their fans for almost 10 years since I was at primary school ;-) <br />
                            I bought 4 tickets: 1 for Osaka, 1 for Sapporo and 2 for Tokyo, all 'golden seats' so the view is gonna be great XD<br />

                            ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
                            Start from OSAKA!!!<br />
                            ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />

                            FEB 5th <br />
                            I've already known that Queen is popular in Japan, but to my surprise...the customs officer is a huge fan of them! <br />
                            <br />
                            Customs Officer: 😑 **Seriously** Why do you come to Japan? <br />
                            Me: 😮 Well...I just wanna travel around Japan and watch Queen concerts btw <br />
                            Customs Officer: **SHOCKED** 😉 OH QUEEN! I LOVE THEM!!! OK Man, NO PROBLEM <br />

                            ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
                            FEB 8th<br />
                            I flew to Sapporo. <br />
                            SNOW, SNOW and SNOW everywhere. To a boy living in a warm city, Sapporo is a new world.<br />
                            <br />
                            FEB 9th<br />
                            My student(Yes, I was and I am a tutor teaching Calculus outside the school.) <br />
                            asked me if I could take a photo of Cute Snow Sculpture in Odori Park that is near my hotel. <br />
                            <br />
                            YES I DID IT <br />
                            <img src="images/CHIKAWA.jpg" height="600px" width="800px" />
                            <br />
                            AND GUESS WHO I ENCOUNTERED IN THE PARK??? <br />
                            <br />
                            BRIAN MAY!!!<br />
                            <br />
                            OK we had met before (in London, just check 'England ROCKS!' on 'Listen up!'), so he recognized me! <br />
                            Since he's walking around the park privately...I didn't ask for any photos or autographs. <br />
                            <br />
                            He was buying some French fries. <br />
                            We had a brief talk, and I asked if I could have a hug...he said 'SURE!'<br />
                            AND he shared French fries with me! <br />
                            <br />
                            At 2am he replied my email...<br />
                            "Enjoy the show! Bri XXX" <br />
                            <br />
                            OF COURSE I WILL! He is so cute! :)<br />
                            <br />
                            -----------------------------------<br />

                            <br />
                            I didn't record any video cuz I was immersed myself into the show. <br />
                            My seat was close to the stage...so the effect was astonishing.<br />
                            Feb 10 is also CHINESE NEW YEAR EVE in 2024, so this day has a special meaning to me...<br />
                            this is the best NEW YEAR I've ever enjoyed.<br />

                            I was attending the Physics summer school at <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London</a> <br />
                            Almost every Rock n' Roll fans know, that QUEEN the band started at Imperial :) <br />

                            Blackett Labortory, where Brian, the guitarist of QUEEN, started his career as an Astronomer in 1964. <br />

                            <br />
                            This marks for their first show in London (at Imperial College Union) as a student band.

                            Who can imagine a student band to be one of the GOAT 🐐?!!! <br />

                            After the first day at the summer school...<br />
                            THEN...JUST STUDY STUDY STUDY AND STUDY...till the weekend! <br />
                            I walked around...Garden Lodge, where Freddie used to live, is near Imperial College. <br />
                            I took the photo without disturbing anyone inside. <br />
                            <img src="images/GardenLodge.jpg" height="750px" width="1000px" />
                            <br />
                            After the summer school...I traveled around England. <br />
                            <br />
                            I would like to call this journey a 'Pilgrimage of ROCK'.<br />
                            <br />
                            -------------------<br />
                            July 17, London <br />
                            -------------------<br />
                            <br />
                            I went to Abbey Road, didnt take any photo cuz MY PHONE WAS DEAD. <br />
                            Fortunately, Brian May was in Abbey Road Studio, having a party celebrating the remastered album 'Star Fleet' <br />
                            <img src="images/StarFleet.jpg" height="1200px" width="1000px" />
                            <br />
                            I went to about 8 CD stores, all sold out. Finally bought one in the 9th store I visited. <br />
                            <br />
                            I have to say, this is a fun album, I'll rate it as A+. <br />
                            Salute to Brian & EVH for their awesome Blues & Rock jams in this album :) <br />
                            <br />
                            It was about 6PM, the party was over. <br />
                            Outside the studio, Brian signed on my hoddie :) <br />
                            WHAT A NICE GUY!<br />
                            I told him that I am a Physics student inspired by him. <br />
                            He seemed surprised and shook my hand. <br />

                            <br />
                            BTW, his driver Phil, a retired British Royal Navy officer, is also soooooo NICE! <br />
                            He is a guy with a great sense of humor XD! He chated with me outside the studio and taught me how to salute like a soldier :-) <br />
